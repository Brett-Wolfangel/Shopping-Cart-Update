# Shopping-Cart-Update
This assignment was an exam in which we had to digest the given code and make changes to the shopping cart. 
My changes are commented in the view folder under add_item_view, and start on line 29.
For this assignment, I connected to the given database in MyPhpAdmin, and wrote a query to get productName and listPrice.
I then iterated throught the products table and grabbed the productName and listPrice.
After that, I assigned variable names and printed the products to the dropdown for the customer to select a product to purchase.
